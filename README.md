# GameOfLifeUnity

As a way of practicing my Unity skills I decided to implement Conways Game of Life in Unity 3D.

### The Board
The game board is made up of many instantiated cube primitives, these cubes resemble one cell of the game board.
There are 3 preset sizes (small : 10x10, medium: 30x30, and large: 50x50) any more than that many cubes on screen at once causes
frame rate issues. 

Here's a look at the blank board from a top down view at its largest size.
